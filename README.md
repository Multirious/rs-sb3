# rs-sb3

Rust crate with Serde implementation for json part in .sb3 format. (the Scratch 3 project format)

'extensions' and 'text_to_speech_language' has yet to be implemented (I'm tired) but is planned.
Mostly anything else is completely (*probably*) implemented.

Some documentation are taken from the Scratch Wiki.

# Usage
You can raw-dog this crate by unzip the sb3 file and take the json part of it and do whatever you want with it.
But this crate is made to be use with my other in development crate that is a Scratch project builder.
