# rs-sb3

Rust crate with Serde implementation for json part in .sb3 format. (the Scratch 3 project format)

'extensions' and 'text_to_speech_language' has yet to be implemented (I'm tired) but is planned.
Mostly anything else is completely (*probably*) implemented.

Some documentation are taken from the Scratch Wiki.
